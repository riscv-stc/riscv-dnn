The repro uses riscv-v instruction to realize the dnn

* dataset: the input data for dnn models. All data is from the **pb** file.
* include: the public head file
* src: the operators for dnn
* test: test operator and models
    * models: test modles
    * ops: test operator

## Add operators

add your own operators at *src* directory

## Add models

add your own models at *test/models* directory

## Test operators

Before you test ops, you must clean the *.o* and *.bin* files

```
cd test/ops
rm */*.o */*.bin
```

for example, run **add** operator test:
```
cd  test/ops/add
rm *.o *.bin
python3 test.py sim
```

* sim = spike or gem5 or vcs, default is spike. If sim = gem5, you must fix the gem5 path variance **GEM5** in *common.mk* 
* test.py: generate the input data and golden output, and check the golden with operator result
* test.c: read the input file which is generated by **py** file, run the opertors, and store the result

After run the **py** file, you will get the **check**, **build** and **perf**diretory. 

* **check** contains the compared result with golden.
* **build** contains the run *elf* file, input data, output data, perf data, tma picture, and run log
* **perf**  summary the tma perf data for all testcases. you can open *report.html* as following:
    * `firefox report.html`
    * `google-chrome report.html`
